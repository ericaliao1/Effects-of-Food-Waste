<h1> Effects of Food Waste</h1>

<h2> What is Food Waste? </h2>
<p> Food waste is when edible scraps of food are not eaten or are discarded. About 119 billion pounds of food is wasted in the United States, or around 35%-40% of all food in the USA. $408 billion in food is thrown away each year. </p>

<h3> How is Food Wasted? </h3>
<p> Crops can remain in fields if there is not enough demand for them or because of low crop prices. At supermarkets, fruit and vegetables that are deemed "ugly" are thrown out before they are even put out for sale. Uneaten or expired foods are thrown out at homes, stores, and restaurants. </p>

<h2> Environmental Impacts </h2>
<p> Food waste produces about 67 million metric tons of methane each year. This accounts for about 20% of the world's methane emissions. Methane is 80 times more harmful to the Earth than CO2. </p>

<h2> How to Prevent Food Waste </h2>
<p> To prevent food waste, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only buy what you need</li>
  <li>Buy "ugly" foods (taste is not affected!)</li>
 <li>Compost</li>
  <li>Use/eat leftovers</li>
 <li>Freeze foods</li>
</ul>

<h3> SB 1383 </h3>
<p> SB 1383 is a law implemented by California to help reduce food waste and emissions caused by it. This program includes the implementation of mandatory waste bins that are dedicated for composting. Food scraps, spoiled food, tea bags and coffee grounds, food-soiled paper, yard trimmings, etc. can all be put into this green waste bin. <p/>
